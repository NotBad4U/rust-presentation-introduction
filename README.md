Introduction to Rust language and its ecosystem. Goal is to ease starting with Rust for people with knowledge of an high-level language as Java.

* Language (3 foundations)
  * Productivity: functional-style, no manual memory management, strong and infered typing
  * Performance: native compilation through LLVM, âˆ…GC, low-level language
  * Safety : memory safety, no concurrent access
  * Features
    * struct / trait / generics
    * ownership / borrowing
    * memory guarantees : Box / Arc
    * macro
* Ecosystem :
  * IDE, tests, debugger, RLS (?)
  * Build et package manager (Cargo)
  * Librairies (Rayon, Rocket, Nom)
