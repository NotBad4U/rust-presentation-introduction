## Fearless Concurrency with Rust

> Rust doesnâ€™t like data-races

## How do you make concurrency _painless_ ?

---

### Same tools that make Rust safe !

In Rust, threads are _isolated_ from each other automatically, due to _ownership_.

NOTE:
Writes can only happen when the thread has mutable access, either by owning the data, or by having a mutable borrow of it.
Either way, the thread is guaranteed to be the only one with access at the time. To see how this plays out, letâ€™s look at locks.

Example from [Data Race Detector](https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html)

``` go
func main() {
    c := make(chan bool)
    m := make(map[string]string)

    go func() {
       m["1"] = "a" // First conflicting access.
       c <- true
    }()

    m["2"] = "b" // Second conflicting access.
    <-c

    for k, v := range m {
       fmt.Println(k, v)
    }
}
```

NOTE:
Here is an example of a data race that can lead to crashes and memory corruption:

> Go will happily compile and run the code above

## Rust version

```rust
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    let mut m = HashMap::new();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        m.insert("1", "a");
        tx.send(true);
    });

    m.insert("2", "b");
    rx.recv();

    for (k, v) in &m {
        println!("{}, {}", k, v);
    }
}
```

NOTE:
We can force our closure to take ownership of its environment with the move keyword:

> Every _data type_ knows whether it can safely be sent between or accessed by multiple threads

- A type is _Send_ if it is safe to _send_ it to another thread.
- A type is _Sync_ if it is safe to _share_ between threads (_&T_ is _Send_).

## Message passing

> Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

> \- Effective Go

##Â Channel API

```rust
fn send<T: Send>(chan: &Channel<T>, t: T);
        ^^^^^^^                    ^^^^^^^


fn recv<T: Send>(chan: &Channel<T>) -> T;
        ^^^^^^^
```

> _T_ must be considered _safe_ to send between threads

NOTE:
Take ownership + Send
Actor

## [Channel](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html): MPSC

```rust
let (tx1, rx) = mpsc::channel();
let tx2 = tx1.clone();

thread::spawn(move || tx1.send(vec![1, 2]));

thread::spawn(move || tx2.send(vec![3, 4]));

for scores in rx {
    println!("Received : {:?}", scores);
}
```

    let mut scores = vec![2, 4];
    tx.send(scores);

## Shared memory in Rust is opt-in

> "Shared-state concurrency is nevertheless a fundamental programming style, needed for systems code, for maximal performance, and for implementing other styles of concurrency."

---

##Â Lock on Data

- `Mutex`: A mutual exclusion primitive for protecting shared data

- `Arc`: Atomic Reference Count (Arc is `Send`)

- `RefCell`, `Cell`, ...

---

### Rustâ€™s approach to concurrency:

- Memory safety without garbage collection.

- Concurrency without data races.

- The _compiler_ prevents all data races.
